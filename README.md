Collection of Arduino sketches for interacting with the data bus utilized on various Chrysler vehicles circa 1980-2000. 

Basic code to read the Chrysler CCD bus via UART. Write code is being worked on by Chris O and Chris (Ascension) at the moment 3-26-2016.

1MHz clock generation done via external oscillator (PN MXO45HS-3C-1M0000 - available @ DigiKey).

Sketch utilizes Intersil CDP68HC68S1E. Is available through eBay and AliExpress
